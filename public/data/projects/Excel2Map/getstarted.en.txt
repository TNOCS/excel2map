# Getting started with Excel2map
First download an Excel-file and the macros you need to create a map layer and save them in one folder: <a href="data/excel2map_online_adressen.xlsm" target="_blank">example Excel template</a>. Prepare the Excel-file by configuring all names, descriptions and styles. When you are ready, click the ' Upload to map '-button to upload the data from your Excel file to a map.
